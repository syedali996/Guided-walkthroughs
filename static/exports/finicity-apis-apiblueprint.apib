### RefreshCustomerAccountsByInstitutionLogin [POST]
Refresh account and transaction data for all accounts associated with a given `institutionLoginId` with a connection to the institution.

Client apps are not permitted to automate calls to the Refresh services. Active accounts are automatically refreshed by Finicity once per day. Because many financial institutions only post transactions once per day, calling Refresh repeatedly is usually a waste of resources and is not recommended.

Apps may call Refresh services for a specific customer when there is a specific business case for the need of data that is up to date as of the moment. Please discuss with your account manager and systems engineer for further clarification.

The recommended timeout setting for this request is 120 seconds in order to receive a response. However, you can terminate the connection after making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to know when the refresh is complete.

# Group Transactions

Fetch customer and account transactions and generate reports asynchronously

## Aggregation V1 Customers Accounts Transactions Historic [/aggregation/v1/customers/{customerId}/accounts/{accountId}/transactions/historic]

+ Parameters
    + customerId (string, required)

        A customer ID

        + Sample: 1005061234
    + accountId (string, required)

        The account ID

        + Sample: 5011648377

### LoadHistoricTransactionsForCustomerAccount [POST]
Connect to the account's financial institution and load up to 24 months of historic transactions for the account. Length of history varies by institution.

This is a premium service. The billable event is a call to this service specifying a customer ID that has not been seen before by this service. (If this service is called multiple times with the same customer ID, to load transactions from multiple accounts, only one billable event has occurred.)

The recommended timeout setting for this request is 180 seconds in order to receive a response. However, you can terminate the connection after making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to know when the refresh is complete.

The date range sent to the institution is calculated from the account's `createdDate`. This means that calling this service a second time for the same account normally will not add any new transactions for the account. For this reason, a second call to this service for a known account ID will usually return immediately.

In a few specific scenarios, it may be desirable to force a second connection to the institution for a known account ID. Some examples are:

* The institution's policy has changed, making more transactions available
* Finicity has now added a longer transaction history support for the institution
* The first call encountered an error, and the resulting Aggregation Ticket has now been fixed by the Finicity Support Team

In these cases, the POST request can contain the parameter `force=true` in the request body to force the second connection.

# Group TxPush

Manage TxPush subscriptions

## Aggregation V1 Customers Accounts Txpush [/aggregation/v1/customers/{customerId}/accounts/{accountId}/txpush]

+ Parameters
    + customerId (string, required)

        A customer ID

        + Sample: 1005061234
    + accountId (string, required)

        The account ID

        + Sample: 5011648377

### SubscribeToTxPushNotifications [POST]
Register a client app's TxPush Listener to receive TxPush notifications related to the given account.

Each call to this service will return two records, one with class account and one with class transaction. Account events are sent when values change in the account's fields (such as `balance` or `interestRate`). Transaction events are sent whenever a new transaction is posted for the account. For institutions that do not provide TxPush services, notifications are sent as soon as Finicity finds a new transaction or new account data through regular aggregation processes.

The listener's URL must be secure (HTTPS) for any real-world account. In addition, the client's TxPush Listener will need to be verified. HTTP and HTTPS connections are only allowed on the standard ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). The use of other ports will result with the call failing.

For additional details on this process, see [TxPush Listener Service](https://docs.finicity.com/txpush-listener-service/).

## Decisioning V2 Customers VoieTxVerify WithInterview [/decisioning/v2/customers/{customerId}/voieTxVerify/withInterview{?callbackUrl}]

+ Parameters
    + customerId (string, required)

        A customer ID

        + Sample: 1005061234

### GenerateVOIEPaystubWithTXVerifyReport [POST]
Generate a VOIE - Paystub (with TXVerify) report for all checking and savings under the given customer. This service retrieves up to two years of transaction history for the given accounts. It then uses this information as well as the provided paystub(s), which are passed into the request body as asset IDs (generated using the Store Customer Pay Statement API) to generate the VOIE - Paystub (with TXVerify) report.

Note: if you are using this API to refresh the bank transactions, use the same asset ID from the first report. A new paystub is not required unless the paystub is too old for underwriting requirements. Using the same asset ID that was on the original report and the previously extracted details will be used to speed up report generation response time.

This is a premium service. The billing rate is the variable rate for VOIE TXVerify under the current subscription plan. The billable event is the successful generation of a VOIE TXVerify Report.

    Note: when the `singleUseUrl` and the `experience` parameters are passed in the same call, the `singleUseUrl` value overrides the `singleUseUrl` value configured in the `experience` parameter.

+ `experience`: `default` (string, optional)

    The `experience` field allows you to customize:
    * Brand: color and logo
    * Icon: displayed on the "Share your data" page 
    * Popular institutions: displayed on the Bank Search page 
    * Report: the credit decisioning report to send when Connect completes. 
    * MVS modules: financial, payroll, paystub
    
    Note: the Finicity sales engineers (SE) help you set up a default experience for your company when you migrate to Connect 2.0. For each additional experience you create thereafter, they'll give you a unique ID. See [Generate 2.0 Connect URL APIs](https://docs.finicity.com/migrate-to-connect-web-sdk-2-0/#migrate-connect-web-sdk-1).
    
    Experience values options: 
    * "default": your default experience (must be defined) 
    * GUID: the code for a different experience
    * Not defined: If you don't pass the experience parameter, then Connect's out of the box default experience (add accounts but no branding) is used, and the MVS modules will not run.

Example: 1494449017. If it's greater than 10 digits, then the `fromDate` is set to the credit decisioning report's default `fromDate`.
    
    For an experience that generates multiple reports, the `fromDate` gets passed to the reports that support it.
    
    However, Connect doesn't pass this parameter to the following reports:
    * Pay Statement Extraction Report 
    * VOIE - Paystub (with TXVerify) Report 
    * Statement Report 
    * Verification of Income Report 
    * VOIE - Payroll Report 
    
    Note: this field isn't used if you're only collecting transaction data without a report.

+ `reportCustomFields` (array[ReportCustomField], optional)

    The `reportCustomFields` parameter is used when experiences are associated with a credit decisioning report.
    
    Designate up to 5 custom fields that you'd like associated with the report when it's generated. Every custom field consists of three variables: `label`, `value`, and `shown`. The `shown` variable is "true" or "false".
    * "true": (default) display the custom field in the PDF report
    * "false": don't display the custom field in the PDF report
    
    For an experience that generates multiple reports, the `reportCustomFields` parameter gets passed to all reports.
    
    All custom fields display in the Reseller Billing API.
